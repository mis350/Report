## Report

An Application used to report traffic accidents used by any user (the reporter). The Hot Line will recieve the report then it will be send to the accurate department suc as: raffic policeman, ambulance, firefighters according to the report status and description wich was written by the reporter. 

The program encourage all citizens to be responcibile. Also, to speed up rescue missions and reduce damages and losses. Citizens can send an incident by writting the adress and a describtoin for it. In the future we attend to add new features like: attaching a video or a photo, or an audio note. Also, the location of the accident and tracking system for the reporting person.
